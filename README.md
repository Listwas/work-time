# work-time

tiny terminal script to track how long you’ve been working.  
no ui, no features, just a timer in the console.

## how it works

- run the script  
- it shows when you started  
- it updates the elapsed time every second  
- press **Ctrl+C** to stop  
- after stopping, it prints total time worked

## usage

```bash
python work_time.py
